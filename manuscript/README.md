Some of the data used in this project are not publically available.
Synthetic data with similar characteristics to the original data have been provided. Using the function load_data() will load these synthetic data when the original data are unavailable. Note that these synthetic data cannot be used to reproduce the original results. However, it does allow users to run the code and, optionally, generate valid code that can be evaluated using the original data by the project authors.
To request access to the original data, [open a GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue).

<!--Clarify here how users should contact you to gain access to the data, or to submit syntax for evaluation on the original data.-->
